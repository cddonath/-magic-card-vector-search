# Magic: The Gathering Vector Search Engine
A magic the gathering card search tool that uses samntic similarity rather than just keywords. Easier to you for new players like myself when trying to build a deck!  
Technologies used will include Weaviate(built in AI and machine learning integration), OpenAI, python, node.js and next.js  
*
Prerequisites: List any necessary software (e.g., Node.js, Python, Docker (if using local Weaviate)).  
*
Cloning the Repository: Explain how to clone your GitHub repository to their local machine using git clone <repository_url>. You can find your repository URL on the main page of your repository (the green "Code" button).  
*
Setting up Weaviate: Explain the process of creating a Weaviate Cloud cluster and obtaining the necessary credentials (Weaviate URL and API key).  
*
Obtaining API Keys: Detail how to get an OpenAI API key. Emphasize the importance of not sharing these keys publicly and using an environment variables file.  
*
Installation of Dependencies: Explain how to install the required packages for your backend and frontend (e.g., using npm install for Node.js projects or pip install -r requirements.txt for Python projects, if you create a requirements.txt file).  
*
Configuration: Describe how to configure your project with the API keys and Weaviate credentials, likely by creating an .env file or a similar mechanism to load environment variables. Refer back to the concept of the .env file you used.  
*
Database Setup: Briefly mention how to create the Weaviate schema and upload the Magic: The Gathering data, potentially referencing the code you wrote for this process.  
*
Running the Application: Explain how to start your backend API and frontend (e.g., npm start or python your_api_script.py).
